PHP-Linux-Process-Monitor
=========================

Very simple (yet very handy) PHP script to monitor Server processes through web interface

I consider myself as good programmer, but also know that I am horrible designer.

This ugly PHP script will enable you to monitor Your server processes via browser. It is good replacement to cPanel Process Manager in case you decided to break up with cPanel. Actually I made this one for myself but I thought It is useful to share since I couldn't find an equivalent. Tested in Linux CentOS 7, PHP 6.3 and jQuery 2.1.

Install
=======
Copy the PHP file to your server and call it from your  browser.
